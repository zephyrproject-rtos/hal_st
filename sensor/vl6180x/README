Status:
   version 1.4.0

Purpose:
   ST Microelectonics official API to use vl6180 sensor.

Description:
   This library written by STMicroelectronics is dedicated to vl6180 time of flight sensor.
   Instead of providing a full description of the registers, ST decided to provide a C library to drive this sensor.

   This library is called from the vl6180 driver and is kept transparent for user.
   User is calling a standard Zephyr driver and then, the driver makes some calls to this library.

   In order to fit with Zephyr rules and simplify version updates, we have done a minimum of modifications :
      - keep only API directory
        (remove documentation and samples, see ST website for this)
      - rename Api to api
      - customize api/platform to fit in Zephyr (mainly for I2C access)
        vl53l0x_platform.c has been moved to Zephyr drivers directory.

   In order to use this library, you have to :
      * define CONFIG_HAS_STLIB and CONFIG_VL53L0X
      * use 1 in prj.conf (needed for abs function)
      * include vl53l0x_api.h and vl53l0x_platform.h in the driver .h

Dependencies:
   This package depends on Zephyr I2C implementation and is linked statically.
   This library will be used by a standard Zephyr driver.
