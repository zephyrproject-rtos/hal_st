Status:
   version 1.0.7

Purpose:
   ST Microelectonics official API to use vl53l5cx sensor.

Description:
   This library written by STMicroelectronics is dedicated to vl53l5cx time of flight sensor.

   This library is called from the vl53l5cx driver and is kept transparent for user.
   User is calling a standard Zephyr driver and then the driver makes some calls to this library.

   In order to fit with Zephyr rules and simplify version updates, we have done a minimum of modifications:
      - split headers and source to inc/src
      - keep only API directory
        (remove documentation and samples, see ST website for this)

   In order to use this library, you have to:
      * define CONFIG_HAS_STLIB and CONFIG_VL53L5CX
      * include vl53l5cx_api.h and vl53l1_platform.h in the driver .h
      * depending on your I2C controller implementation you will need to define VL53L5CX_BUF_ATTRIBUTES
        to place the larger buffers into a dmable memory region

Dependencies:
   This package depends on Zephyr I2C implementation and is linked statically.
   This library will be used by a standard Zephyr driver.
