Status:
   version v1.00

Purpose:
   ST Microelectronics standard C platform-independent drivers for MEMS
   motion and environmental sensors.

Description:
   This package is an extract (examples have not been retained) of official
   C-Driver-MEMS package written by ST Microelectronics.
   It contains standard drivers for STMicroelectronics MEMS sensors to
   provide a common and stable interface to access sensor registers.
   For each supported sensor following files are provided:

       - xyz_reg.c: contains the function to read/write 'xyz' sensor registers
       - xyz_reg.h: contains structures and defines to describe in details
                    the 'xyz' sensor registers.

   The driver is platform-independent, you only need to define the two
   functions for read and write transactions from the sensor hardware bus
   (ie. SPI or I2C).

   Define in your 'xyz' driver code the read and write functions that use the
   I2C or SPI platform driver like the following:

   /** Please note that is MANDATORY: return 0 -> no Error.**/
   int platform_wr(void *handle, u8_t reg, u8_t *bufp, u16_t len);
   int platform_rd(void *handle, u8_t reg, u8_t *bufp, u16_t len);

   xyz_ctx_t xyz_ctx = {
       .read_reg = (xyz_read_ptr) platform_rd,
       .write_reg = (xyz_write_ptr) platform_wr,
   };

Dependencies:
    None.
